# M4Singer Parsing Scripts

The file format is kinda messy so here's some scripts lmao
You can repurpose these so that's why they're here. They'll run in all subfolders so be warned.

## Script List

| Script | Function |
| ------ | ------ |
| del_midi.py | Deletes all .mid files in the current folder and subfolder. |
| update_textgrid.py | This updates the TextGrid file to the current format. |
| lab2diffsinger.py | Basically just an update to the single one to run through subfolders as well. |
| segment_audio.py | Basically just an update to the single one to run through subfolders as well.  |
| textgrid2lab.py | This converts your .TextGrid files to .lab files. You should change tier.name if you plan on using it on datasets other than M4Singer. |
